## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, EZ-Builder was born. The EZ-Builder software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This Temp sensor design is one of them. This sensor measures Temperature in degree Celsius as an Analog Voltage. It has a scale factor of 10mV/°C. This project is currently in progress, expect major changes to occur. We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!
